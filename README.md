# USDA-BBS 1134 vaccination of broiler chickens reduces cecal colonization and systemic dissemination of serogroup D Enteritidis with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (DSC)
Of the >2600 serovars of Salmonella, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) is one of most common serovars associated with human illness in the U.S. and worldwide. Surveillance from the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) indicates an increase in both chicken and human isolates of S. Enteritidis with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, a critical antibiotic prescribed for complicated human salmonellosis infections. Frequently associated with chicken products, S. Enteritidis reduction in chickens (including DSC S. Enteritidis) is a priority of poultry producers and public health agencies to improve food safety. In the current study, efficacy assessment of a live Salmonella vaccine (BBS 1134) revealed significant reduction (>2 Log) of intestinal (cecal) colonization and systemic (spleen) dissemination of DSC S. Enteritidis in broiler chickens. DSC S. Enteritidis disseminated to bone marrow in 38% of the mock-vaccinated chickens at 7 days post-inoculation, but vaccination prevented dissemination to the bone marrow. Microbiome analysis of the chicken cecal contents indicated the microbiota of BBS 1134-vaccinated chickens is distinct compared to the mock-vaccinated birds. Prior to inoculation with DSC S. Enteritidis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) revealed a significantly higher level of circulating antibodies (IgY) that bind epitopes from the vaccine strain in the vaccinated chickens compared to the mock-vaccinated chickens. The IDEXX SE Ab X2 Test did not detect antibodies to S. Enteritidis in the vaccinated chicken serum, thereby permitting differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) because the vaccine will not interfere with flock level monitoring for S. Enteritidis. Altogether, the USDA BBS 1134 Salmonella vaccine is a DIVA vaccine, afforded cross-protection, and significantly reduced intestinal colonization and splenic dissemination as well as prevented dissemination to the bone marrow by DSC S. Enteritidis in broiler chickens, thereby offering a prospective intervention for animal production to reduce food product contamination and improve food safety.
